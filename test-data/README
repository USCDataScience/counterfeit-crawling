The crawl-test folders contain statistics from test crawls of depth <= 3. The instances 
contain deeper crawls.

crawl-test-1: Initial crawl with configuration for politeness, agent rotation, etc.

crawl-test-2: Crawl with more advanced configurations, and including image suffixes.

instance-1: Crawl with protocol-interactiveselenium and similarity scoring plugins. Did not 
split seed URLs into separate crawls, so crawl focused mostly on a couple hostnames and 
not all the desired ones.

instance-2: Crawl with protocol-interactiveselenium and similarity scoring plugins. Crawled in 
single fetcher mode and merged crawldb's for each URL in seed.
