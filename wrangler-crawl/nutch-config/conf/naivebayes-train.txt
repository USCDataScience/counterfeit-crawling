1	A mixed-signal integrated circuit is any integrated circuit that has both analog circuits and digital circuits on a single semiconductor die. In real-life applications mixed-signal designs are everywhere, for example, a smart mobile phone. However, it is more accurate to call them mixed-signal systems. Mixed-signal ICs also process both analog and digital signals together. For example, an analog-to-digital converter is a mixed-signal circuit. Mixed-signal circuits or systems are typically cost-effective solutions for building any modern consumer electronics applications.

1	Multiple developments were required to achieve this increased density. Manufacturers moved to smaller design rules and cleaner fabrication facilities, so that they could make chips with more transistors and maintain adequate yield. The path of process improvements was summarized by the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). Design tools improved enough to make it practical to finish these designs in a reasonable time. The more energy-efficient CMOS replaced NMOS and PMOS, avoiding a prohibitive increase in power consumption. In 1986 the first one-megabit RAM chips were introduced, containing more than one million transistors. Microprocessor chips passed the million-transistor mark in 1989 and the billion-transistor mark in 2005. The trend continues largely unabated, with chips introduced in 2007 containing tens of billions of memory transistors

0	Mark Zuckerberg is one of the most powerful men in the world because billions of people give Facebook, which he founded, free access to their personal data. In return, users receive carefully curated snapshots of his life: baby photos, mundane office tours and the occasional 5K. On Tuesday, observers were reminded that Mr. Zuckerberg, 32, is not just a normal guy who enjoys running and quiet dinners with friends. In a photo posted to his Facebook account, he celebrated the growing user base of Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. An eagle-eyed Twitter user named Chris Olson noticed that in the image’s background, his laptop camera and microphone jack appeared to be covered with tape. The taped-over camera and microphone jack are usually a signal that someone is concerned, perhaps only vaguely, about hackers’ gaining access to his or her devices by using remote-access trojans — a process called “ratting.” (Remote access is not limited to ratters: According to a cache of National Security Agency documents leaked by Edward J. Snowden, at least two government-designed programs were devised to take over computer cameras and microphones.)

0	Phil Jackson will get to explain on Thursday evening what inspired him to bet on Derrick Rose and his surgically repaired knees, as Jackson is scheduled to address the news media before the N.B.A. draft begins. On its own, the multiplayer deal Jackson made Wednesday with the Chicago Bulls offers clues as to what is on his mind as he again reconfigures the Knicks in advance of his third full season as the team’s president. Not many would have figured Rose to be Jackson’s kind of point guard, Rose appearing to be from the kind of ball-dominant, screen-and-roll, high-volume-shooter school of basketball that Jackson has taken every opportunity to denigrate since he returned to New York.

0	A new report from the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank based in Washington, D.C., points out that income inequality has risen in every state since the 1970s, and the income gap widened significantly in some states after the Great Recession. The report, "Income inequality in the U.S. by state, metropolitan area, and county," analyzes tax data reported by the Internal Revenue Service, with a particular focus on income trends between 2009 and 2013. In that time, 15 states saw the top 1% account for all income growth, while average earnings fell among the bottom 99%. Here's a list of those states, in reverse order of income gap:

0	Donald Trump delivered a blistering attack Wednesday on Hillary Clinton's record as secretary of state, accusing her of milking oppressive regimes of tens of millions of dollars to benefit the Clinton Foundation and calling her a “world-class liar." Clinton had the chance to throw it back at Trump at a campaign
appearance in Raleigh, N.C., but saved her counterpunching for the end of her speech -- in terms she’s used before. She accused him of peddling "empty promises" and having "no answers." The dueling speeches only served to sharpen the tone of an already brutal 2016 race. Speaking at his New York City hotel, Trump said Clinton “perfected the politics of personal profit” and “doesn’t have the temperament ... or the judgment to be president.” He specifically took her and Bill Clinton to task for taking millions from Saudi Arabia and other countries that criminalize homosexuality. Trump suggested Clinton as president would be influenced by all the lobbyists, CEOs and foreign governments who paid the Clintons to give speeches over the years. "They totally own her and that will never, ever change," he said.
